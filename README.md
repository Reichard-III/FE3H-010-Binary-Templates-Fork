A fork of 010 binary templates (https://github.com/three-houses-research-team/010-binary-templates) from Three Houses Research Team

This fork is based on Triabolical's edits to the Three Houses Research Team's 010 binary template, which I cloned and made edits to for my personal use, so things such as the "Category: Reichard" was meant to organize the templates neatly in the templates selection list, not meant as taking ownership of the entire work.

This fork includes some updated information and files discovered by Triabolical ( https://github.com/triabolicals ) and myself, and I later plan to add just the new information/files (without the personal modifications) to the original repository.

In general it was refactored to improve file parsing speed, used clones of enums of different data sizes to be more accurate to the game code (which sometimes revealed some unknown functionality), attempting to clean up and be consistent, replacing char[numChars] with string, etc.
